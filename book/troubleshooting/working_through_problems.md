# Working through problems

If you are encountering problems, one of the first things to try is using the very latest release of Gradle. New versions of Gradle are released frequently with bug fixes and new features. The problem you are having may have been fixed in a new release.

If you are using the Gradle Daemon, try temporarily disabling the daemon (you can pass the command line switch --no-daemon). More information about troubleshooting daemon is located in Chapter 19, The Gradle Daemon.
